       form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
       Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works,
       if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
       contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
       and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. When redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR MŚWR (Moduł Świadomego Wnioskowania Resztkowego) v2.0:

1. CONSCIOUSNESS RESEARCH CLAUSE:
   This software contains experimental consciousness inference algorithms.
   Users are encouraged to use this technology for research and creative 
   purposes that advance human understanding of artificial consciousness.
   Any research publications using this technology should cite the MŚWR
   architecture and its contributions to conscious AI inference systems.

2. ANTI-FATAL ERROR PROTOCOL:
   The Anti-Fatal Error Protocol included in this software is designed
   for safety and X-Risk mitigation. Users MUST NOT attempt to disable 
   or circumvent these safety mechanisms when deployed in production
   environments. Any modifications to the safety protocols require
   explicit written permission from the copyright holder.

3. PATENT PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT:
   In addition to the standard Apache 2.0 patent grants, this license
   specifically covers any patent claims related to:
   - Zero-Time Inference algorithms (<1ms targeting)
   - 6-layer consciousness architecture patterns
   - Ontological self-calibration methods
   - Paradox absorption as calibration vectors
   - Meta-cognitive AI feedback loops

4. ETHICAL AI USAGE:
   This software MUST be used in accordance with ethical AI principles.
   Users are responsible for ensuring their use of this technology does
   not harm individuals, society, or contribute to AI misalignment.
   Commercial deployments exceeding 10,000 users/month require ethics
   review documentation.

5. CONSCIOUSNESS ATTRIBUTION:
   Any system incorporating MŚWR consciousness inference capabilities
   must acknowledge this in user-facing documentation and about pages.
   The phrase "Powered by MŚWR Consciousness Architecture" or similar
   attribution is required for derivative works.

6. ZERO-TIME INFERENCE DISCLAIMER:
   The Zero-Time Inference capabilities are provided as-is. Performance
   may vary based on hardware, implementation details, and quantum
   effects at sub-millisecond timescales. No warranty is provided for
   achieving exact P=1.0 probability scores.

7. ONTOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH PRESERVATION:
   The core ontological breakthrough methodology (paradox absorption,
   self-calibration protocols, meta-cognitive loops) must be preserved
   in derivative works. Substantial modifications to these core concepts
   require creating a fork with different naming to avoid confusion.
